<h1>The generic</h1>
<p>Whether you are building a house, designing a set of genetic experiments, or developing a web app, ultimately the fundamental concepts are similar. They involve planning, implementation of the right tools, and thorough analysis and inspection of the finished product.</p>

<p>Although I am a web-developer, I consider my diverse background in building houses and bench science to be the foundation and proving grounds for my passion in solving complex problems. The dedication and forsight of tackling issues is a vital skill that I bring forward to my projects everyday.</p>

<h2>The unific</h2>

<p>
  In my free-time I like to explore the city with my bicycle, climb the stunning rock faces near me, read an issue of The New Yorker, munch on some delicious food, fly my drone around capturing some great footage at sunrise, and throw some paint on a blank canvas. <br> I also like to read spy-novels and scan the daily post for international affairs issues (hence the web krawler).
