<h1>The generic</h1>
<p>Whether you are building a house, designing a set of genetic experiments, or developing a web app, ultimately the fundamental concepts are similar. They involve planning, implementation of the right tools, and thorough analysis and inspection of the finished product.</p>

<p>Although I am a web-developer, I consider my diverse background in building houses and bench science to be the foundation and proving grounds for my passion in solving complex problems. The dedication and forsight of tackling issues is a vital skill that I bring forward to my projects everyday.</p>

<p>Like any other science, I beleive that every issue can be solved through a holistic understanding of the system that is being worked on. That is why I have set out to contribute to the development community by writing. Not only does this help myself document the work I have done, but it also helps others who may face similar situations.</p>
<p>We have all been in the situation of a quick deadline or gotten a sense of helplessness.  That is why we should all try to help each other out through communication of those problems.</p>

<p>
  In my free-time I like to explore the city with my bicycle, climb the stunning rock faces near me, read an issue of The New Yorker, munch on some delicious food, fly my drone around capturing some great footage at sunrise, and throw some paint on a blank canvas. <br> I also like to read spy-novels and scan the daily post for international affairs issues (hence the web krawler).
