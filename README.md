#Andrew Graham-Yooll's Blog

A blog/site for hosting his resume.

Built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a [StartBootstrapTemplate](https://startbootstrap.com/template-categories/landing-pages/).

Shout out to BlackRockDigital for their fantastic [Jekyll Template](http://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll/)

## My goal(s) with this site

First, this site is a host for my resume. If I could find an employer to look at it, that would be swell.  

But mainly, this site will serve as a kind of tutorial site for myself first and foremost, and for others that happen to run upon it. As a fairly new developer, I have had a tough time learning certain concepts. I hope this blog solidifies my understanding of those aspects of the trade, and possibly helping other out as well.  

Thirdly, I like art. I will be posting my art and other contributors art. Their names and comments will be posted.
